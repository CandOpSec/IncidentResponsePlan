# Insiders compromise of system’s scheme:
## Description of an incident (What is the attack?)
The incident is about compromising system’s scheme to the public or single entity for exploitation.
## Analysis (How big is the impact?)
The impact of this incident should not be enough to bring the company down, but in case of finding any exploitable gaps in the system security we have the following plan.
## Detection (How do you detect?)
As we are not able to detect that kind of attack, we have developed system’s parts rotations to minimize probability of using the gaps.
## How to recover (How to make the system usable/safe again?)
Recovery of such incident is most likely impossible without replacing parts of the system.
## What is the cost of recovery?
Cost of the recovery is the cost of prevention.
## How to stop the attack?
Stopping this attack requires us to prove and test our system for possible vulnerabilities.
How to prevent from Future same/similar incidents
Prevention is the only way to stop that kind of incidents and we are replacing parts of the system at random time intervals/randomly.
## How to avoid similar events in the future?
As the replacing of system parts is quite often, we can say that after few months whole system may work differently.
## What was the cost of the attack?
## Cost of the attack is treated as constant loss of money due to constant changes in the system. What is the cost of prevention?
Constant changes in the system is the cost of prevention.
## Cost/Feasibility difference between Recovery and Prevention (Which is more worth it?)
As the incident’s cost for our company may be very different depending on usage of the system scheme and low probability of detecting, we assume that it will be cheaper to prevent constantly by small changes.
