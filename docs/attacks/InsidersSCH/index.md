# Insiders attack - compromise of system's scheme

### Formal incident response capability
Let us analyse a situation when one may posses the knowledge of system's scheme. By exploiting system security's gaps malevolent entity may posses the knowledge needed to perform hostile actions that will result in a breaking company's security of data and later the possibility to bring entire corporation down. Due to the scale of the possible damages response action will involve many branches of the company to defeat potential catastrophy and draw conclusions for further incidents.
### Incident Response Policy
The policy chosen is to replace faulty system's elements with the new ones. According to the schedule system structure's will behave with differences to the previous version after given amount of time. Given solution makes for the attacker harder to make exploits and use them for harmful actions. Due to the fact once given entity is ready for the attack, the construction that is to be hacked is different than previous, thus making it repeating entire process again.

### Incident Response Plan
Given steps are taken to respond in case of an attack:
1. Management chooses leaders from each team that will form a groups of response.
2. Groups have the meetings needed to be introduced to the problem.
3. The mutual action plan is formed and acknowledged by each memeber.
4. New system parts are being made.
5. Gradually the system construction is being replaced with new parts.
6. Old parts are then send for analysis and finding possible gaps.
7. A report from the incident is being made and published to the company's structures.

### Policies and procedures regarding incident-related information sharing
When it comes to contact with other third party beings Public Relation forms a unit that will take care and forms needed dialogues. The policy is to assure others that company is aware of the problem and is on the way to solve it. Players shall be informed if the incident might have the direct or in some cases indirect impact on them. When the situation is resolved a report for third party users is formed so that all are assured that the solutions implemented made it possible to defeat potential danger.
### Providing information to the appropriate organization
+ In case of using external system's scheme provided by the third party organization Public Relation team shall invite other site to the dialogue to make cooperation as efficient as it is possible.
+ In case if public comes to the knowledge of the situation Public Relation team informs users about the progress of solving the situation and gives further information to solve the concerns of the others.

### Selecting response team model
To handle the incident given teams are selected:
1. Management
2. Core Architecture team 
3. Core Engineering team
4. Core Development team
5. Public Relation team

Management starts to talk with the leaders of each group and they choose the solution to be applied to the problem. Architecture team creates the new part that is to be replaced then presents it to the second team. Engineering team forms given part with cooperation of the first unit. Later third team is presented with given solution and developes new system part. Three teams above teams shall performs tests that will assure as low backward steps as it is possible. When it comes to Public Relation their task is to maintain the contact and talk with public concerned about the situation.
### Selecting people with skills for the incident response team
At first the leader for each group is selected by management of the company. Selected person chooses then other employees that will be working to solve the problem and posses given competences to get the task done. Each group should hold the meeting to get into the topic, which involves presenting the action plan and acknowledging it by each member. Leaders shall also cooperate to solve the problem in a smooth way avoiding any other trouble.
### Identifying other groups for participating in incident handling
If the occurence of knowing that the attacker is one of the member of the company happens management can form a group that will make  employees to be interviewed for the further investigation. Such group will involve:
1. Management
2. Human Resources
3. Internal Audit Team

### Determining services the team should offer
New team formed by the management shall act as investigators and shall work directly under management control. To investigate is to check any data logs, business devices, or other variables that are may be involved. The interrogatory suffies the employees laws of work and does not break any formal documents signed between two sites.
### Prevention steps
It is hard to tell how given attack will affect the company in general. As well as recovery stage requires developing new system parts that are to be plugged into the system. To be sure that one may not have enough time to break the scheme changes in system are made at random time interval thus making the attack less likely to happen, or to make the cost of performing the attack high enough to not be affordable for malevolent entity.
