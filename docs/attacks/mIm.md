# Man in the middle
## Description of an incident (What is the attack?)
MITM between any of our servers and Salesmen endpoints. This attack is based on tampering with the encrypted data sent over the network. We are not able to predict how the attacker can tamper with it, but in case of detection of such attack we have prepared a response plan.
## Analysis (How big is the impact?)
Impact of this attack can be devastating for the legitimate users/buyers of the tickets at given Salesmen point. This way it can bring our business down due to loss of reliability.
## Detection (How do you detect?)
We can detect the attack by sending remote group of guards to gather data collected by Salesmen endpoint devices for further comparison of data on our servers.
## How to recover (How to make the system usable/safe again?)
First step to recover from such attack we have to buy an insurance protocols.
Second step is to pay the prizes to our users/ buyers of the tickets if they have something to prove their rights to the prize.
Third step is to change the connection which was the most likely affected.
## What is the cost of recovery?
The cost of recovery is cost of the insurances and loss of reliability.
## How to stop the attack?
To stop the attack we change as many parts of the inter-network as possible to minimize chances of the attackerâ€™s exploit to succeed.
## How to return to the previous status of the machine?
The reinforcement of the network connections are irreversible for our business.
## How to prevent from Future same/similar incidents
Reinforcing the network connections are at the same time prevention from future similar attacks.
## What was the cost of the attack?
The cost of the attack may vary on number of users affected.
## What is the cost of prevention?
The cost of the prevention is included in cost of the recovery.
## Cost/Feasibility difference between Recovery and Prevention (Which is more worth it?)
As we are not able to predict future vectors of attack we assume that recovery of incidents that occurred is more feasible for us.
